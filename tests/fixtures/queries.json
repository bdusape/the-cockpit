We launched 6 months ago and have seen moderate traction - 100 Chrome extension installs, $2k MRR from 20 paying customers, but growth has plateaued. A well-funded competitor just entered the space with $10M in Series A funding and similar features. Our runway is 8 months. I'm considering three options: (1) Double down on PropIQ and compete directly, (2) Pivot to a content business teaching real estate investing, or (3) Merge the two by building a content-led growth strategy around PropIQ. Which path has the best ROI given my constraints? I have a background in real estate and strong content creation skills, but limited engineering resources (just me). What data should I analyze to make this decision?",
